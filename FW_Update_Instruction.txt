Preparation: a 3d-printer, a micro SD card(format recommended), a micro SD card reader, a computer. 

Step 1: Unzip the compressed firmware package.

Step 2: Correctly insert micro SD card in card reader, then plug the card reader into usb port of computer.

Step 3: Copy the "project.bin" and "Longer3D.UI" two files to the root directory of your micro SD card.

Step 4: Insert prepared micro SD card into printer, then reboot your printer, and update will starts automatically.

	Normally, the screen of printer shows two progress bar(first one for images of user-interface, the second one for main program).
 
	Update progress usually lasts about 30 seconds with fast blink of blue LED light.

	In common, the screen would jumps to the home menu after finishing update.

	If not, please check your steps, and repeat again. If it still fails, format or change your micro SD card and try again.

	*Notice:  Do not power off the printer during the update!

Step 5: Congratulations! Now, you can freely operate your printer with new firmware;

	But, don't forget to delete the two files of "step 3" in your micro SD card, otherwise update will unnecessarily repeats when printer boots.
